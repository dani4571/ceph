- The 'osd min down {reporters|reports}' config options have been
  renamed to 'mon osd min down {reporters|reports}', and the
  documentation has been updated to reflect that these options apply
  to the monitors (who process failure reports) and not OSDs.  If you
  have adjusted these settings, please update your ``ceph.conf''
  accordingly.
