v0.61 "Cuttlefish"
------------------

Upgrading from v0.60
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ceph-deploy tool is now the preferred method of provisioning
  new clusters.  For existing clusters created via mkcephfs that
  would like to transition to the new tool, there is a migration
  path, documented at `Transitioning to ceph-deploy`_.


* The sysvinit script (/etc/init.d/ceph) will now verify (and, if
  necessary, update) the OSD's position in the CRUSH map on startup.
  (The upstart script has always worked this way.) By default, this
  ensures that the OSD is under a 'host' with a name that matches the
  hostname (``hostname -s``).  Legacy clusters create with mkcephfs do
  this by default, so this should not cause any problems, but legacy
  clusters with customized CRUSH maps with an alternate structure
  should set ``osd crush update on start = false``.

* radosgw-admin now uses the term zone instead of cluster to describe
  each instance of the radosgw data store (and corresponding
  collection of radosgw daemons).  The usage for the radosgw-admin
  command and the 'rgw zone root pool' config options have changed
  accordingly.

* rbd progress indicators now go to standard error instead of standard
  out.  (You can disable progress with --no-progress.)

* The 'rbd resize ...' command now requires the --allow-shrink option
  when resizing to a smaller size.  Expanding images to a larger size
  is unchanged.

* Please review the changes going back to 0.56.4 if you are upgrading
  all the way from bobtail.

* The old 'ceph stop_cluster' command has been removed.

* The sysvinit script now uses the ceph.conf file on the remote host
  when starting remote daemons via the '-a' option.  Note that if '-a'
  is used in conjunction with '-c path', the path must also be present
  on the remote host (it is not copied to a temporary file, as it was
  previously).


Upgrading from v0.56.4 "Bobtail"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please see `Upgrading from Bobtail to Cuttlefish`_ for details.

.. _Upgrading from Bobtail to Cuttlefish: ../install/upgrading-ceph/#upgrading-from-bobtail-to-cuttlefish

* The ceph-deploy tool is now the preferred method of provisioning
  new clusters.  For existing clusters created via mkcephfs that
  would like to transition to the new tool, there is a migration
  path, documented at `Transitioning to ceph-deploy`_.

  each instance of the radosgw data store (and corresponding
  collection of radosgw daemons).  The usage for the radosgw-admin
  command and the 'rgw zone root pool' config optoins have changed
  accordingly.

* rbd progress indicators now go to standard error instead of standard
  out.  (You can disable progress with --no-progress.)

* The 'rbd resize ...' command now requires the --allow-shrink option
  when resizing to a smaller size.  Expanding images to a larger size
  is unchanged.

* Please review the changes going back to 0.56.4 if you are upgrading
  all the way from bobtail.

* The old 'ceph stop_cluster' command has been removed.

* The sysvinit script now uses the ceph.conf file on the remote host
  when starting remote daemons via the '-a' option.  Note that if '-a'
  is used in conjuction with '-c path', the path must also be present
  on the remote host (it is not copied to a temporary file, as it was
  previously).

* The monitor is using a completely new storage strategy and
  intra-cluster protocol.  This means that cuttlefish and bobtail
  monitors do not talk to each other.  When you upgrade each one, it
  will convert its local data store to the new format.  Once you
  upgrade a majority, the quorum will be formed using the new protocol
  and the old monitors will be blocked out until they too get
  upgraded.  For this reason, we recommend not running a mixed-version
  cluster for very long.

* ceph-mon now requires the creation of its data directory prior to
  --mkfs, similarly to what happens on ceph-osd.  This directory is no
  longer automatically created, and custom scripts should be adjusted to
  reflect just that.

* The monitor now enforces that MDS names be unique.  If you have
  multiple daemons start with with the same id (e.g., ``mds.a``) the
  second one will implicitly mark the first as failed.  This makes
  things less confusing and makes a daemon restart faster (we no
  longer wait for the stopped daemon to time out) but existing
  multi-mds configurations may need to be adjusted accordingly to give
  daemons unique names.

* The 'ceph osd pool delete <poolname>' and 'rados rmpool <poolname>'
  now have safety interlocks with loud warnings that make you confirm
  pool removal.  Any scripts curenty rely on these functions zapping
  data without confirmation need to be adjusted accordingly.

v0.57
-----

This development release has a lot of additional functionality
accumulated over the last couple months.  Most of the bug fixes (with
the notable exception of the MDS related work) has already been
backported to v0.56.x, and is not mentioned here.

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

* The 'ceph osd pool delete <poolname>' and 'rados rmpool <poolname>'
  now have safety interlocks with loud warnings that make you confirm
  pool removal.  Any scripts curenty rely on these functions zapping
  data without confirmation need to be adjusted accordingly.

v0.56.5 "bobtail"
-----------------

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

* ceph-disk[-prepare,-activate] behavior has changed in various ways.
  There should not be any compatibility issues, but chef users should
  be aware.

Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* mon: fix recording of quorum feature set (important for argonaut -> bobtail -> cuttlefish mon upgrades)
* osd: minor peering bug fixes
* osd: fix a few bugs when pools are renamed
* osd: fix occasionally corrupted pg stats
* osd: fix behavior when broken v0.56[.0] clients connect
* rbd: avoid FIEMAP ioctl on import (it is broken on some kernels)
* librbd: fixes for several request/reply ordering bugs
* librbd: only set STRIPINGV2 feature on new images when needed
* librbd: new async flush method to resolve qemu hangs (requires Qemu update as well)
* librbd: a few fixes to flatten
* ceph-disk: support for dm-crypt
* ceph-disk: many backports to allow bobtail deployments with ceph-deploy, chef
* sysvinit: do not stop starting daemons on first failure
* udev: fixed rules for redhat-based distros
* build fixes for raring

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.56.5.txt>`.

v0.56.4 "bobtail"
-----------------

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

* There is a fix in the syntax for the output of 'ceph osd tree --format=json'.

* The MDS disk format has changed from prior releases *and* from v0.57.  In particular,
  upgrades to v0.56.4 are safe, but you cannot move from v0.56.4 to v0.57 if you are using
  the MDS for CephFS; you must upgrade directly to v0.58 (or later) instead.

Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* mon: fix bug in bringup with IPv6
* reduce default memory utilization by internal logging (all daemons)
* rgw: fix for bucket removal
* rgw: reopen logs after log rotation
* rgw: fix multipat upload listing
* rgw: don't copy object when copied onto self
* osd: fix caps parsing for pools with - or _
* osd: allow pg log trimming when degraded, scrubbing, recoverying (reducing memory consumption)
* osd: fix potential deadlock when 'journal aio = true'
* osd: various fixes for collection creation/removal, rename, temp collections
* osd: various fixes for PG split
* osd: deep-scrub omap key/value data
* osd: fix rare bug in journal replay
* osd: misc fixes for snapshot tracking
* osd: fix leak in recovery reservations on pool deletion
* osd: fix bug in connection management
* osd: fix for op ordering when rebalancing
* ceph-fuse: report file system size with correct units
* mds: get and set directory layout policies via virtual xattrs
* mds: on-disk format revision (see upgrading note above)
* mkcephfs, init-ceph: close potential security issues with predictable filenames

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.56.4.txt>`.

v0.56.3 "bobtail"
-----------------

This release has several bug fixes surrounding OSD stability.  Most
significantly, an issue with OSDs being unresponsive shortly after
startup (and occasionally crashing due to an internal heartbeat check)
is resolved.  Please upgrade.

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

* A bug was fixed in which the OSDMap epoch for PGs without any IO
  requests was not recorded.  If there are pools in the cluster that
  are completely idle (for example, the ``data`` and ``metadata``
  pools normally used by CephFS), and a large number of OSDMap epochs
  have elapsed since the ``ceph-osd`` daemon was last restarted, those
  maps will get reprocessed when the daemon restarts.  This process
  can take a while if there are a lot of maps.  A workaround is to
  'touch' any idle pools with IO prior to restarting the daemons after
  packages are upgraded::

   rados bench 10 write -t 1 -b 4096 -p {POOLNAME}

  This will typically generate enough IO to touch every PG in the pool
  without generating significant cluster load, and also cleans up any
  temporary objects it creates.

Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* osd: flush peering work queue prior to start
* osd: persist osdmap epoch for idle PGs
* osd: fix and simplify connection handling for heartbeats
* osd: avoid crash on invalid admin command
* mon: fix rare races with monitor elections and commands
* mon: enforce that OSD reweights be between 0 and 1 (NOTE: not CRUSH weights)
* mon: approximate client, recovery bandwidth logging
* radosgw: fixed some XML formatting to conform to Swift API inconsistency
* radosgw: fix usage accounting bug; add repair tool
* radosgw: make fallback URI configurable (necessary on some web servers)
* librbd: fix handling for interrupted 'unprotect' operations
* mds, ceph-fuse: allow file and directory layouts to be modified via virtual xattrs

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.56.3.txt>`.


v0.56.2 "bobtail"
-----------------

This release has a wide range of bug fixes, stability improvements, and some performance improvements.  Please upgrade.

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

* The meaning of the 'osd scrub min interval' and 'osd scrub max
  interval' has changed slightly.  The min interval used to be
  meaningless, while the max interval would only trigger a scrub if
  the load was sufficiently low.  Now, the min interval option works
  the way the old max interval did (it will trigger a scrub after this
  amount of time if the load is low), while the max interval will
  force a scrub regardless of load.  The default options have been
  adjusted accordingly.  If you have customized these in ceph.conf,
  please review their values when upgrading.

* CRUSH maps that are generated by default when calling ``ceph-mon
  --mkfs`` directly now distribute replicas across hosts instead of
  across OSDs.  Any provisioning tools that are being used by Ceph may
  be affected, although probably for the better, as distributing across
  hosts is a much more commonly sought behavior.  If you use
  ``mkcephfs`` to create the cluster, the default CRUSH rule is still
  inferred by the number of hosts and/or racks in the initial ceph.conf.

Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* osd: snapshot trimming fixes
* osd: scrub snapshot metadata
* osd: fix osdmap trimming
* osd: misc peering fixes
* osd: stop heartbeating with peers if internal threads are stuck/hung
* osd: PG removal is friendlier to other workloads
* osd: fix recovery start delay (was causing very slow recovery)

v0.56.1 "bobtail"
-----------------

This release has two critical fixes.  Please upgrade.

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

* There is a protocol compatibility problem between v0.56 and any
  other version that is now fixed.  If your radosgw or RBD clients are
  running v0.56, they will need to be upgraded too.  If they are
  running a version prior to v0.56, they can be left as is.

Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* osd: fix commit sequence for XFS, ext4 (or any other non-btrfs) to prevent data loss on power cycle or kernel panic
* osd: fix compatibility for CALL operation
* osd: process old osdmaps prior to joining cluster (fixes slow startup)
* osd: fix a couple of recovery-related crashes
* osd: fix large io requests when journal is in (non-default) aio mode
* log: fix possible deadlock in logging code

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.56.1.txt>`.

v0.56 "bobtail"

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to the document `Upgrading from Argonaut to Bobtail`_ for details.

.. _Upgrading from Argonaut to Bobtail: ../install/upgrading-ceph/#upgrading-from-argonaut-to-bobtail

* Cephx authentication is now enabled by default (since v0.55).
  Upgrading a cluster without adjusting the Ceph configuration will
  likely prevent the system from starting up on its own.  We recommend
  first modifying the configuration to indicate that authentication is
  disabled, and only then upgrading to the latest version.::

     auth client required = none
     auth service required = none
     auth cluster required = none

* Ceph daemons can be upgraded one-by-one while the cluster is online
  and in service.

* The ``ceph-osd`` daemons must be upgraded and restarted *before* any
  ``radosgw`` daemons are restarted, as they depend on some new
  ceph-osd functionality.  (The ``ceph-mon``, ``ceph-osd``, and
  ``ceph-mds`` daemons can be upgraded and restarted in any order.)

* Once each individual daemon has been upgraded and restarted, it
  cannot be downgraded.

* The cluster of ``ceph-mon`` daemons will migrate to a new internal
  on-wire protocol once all daemons in the quorum have been upgraded.
  Upgrading only a majority of the nodes (e.g., two out of three) may
  expose the cluster to a situation where a single additional failure
  may compromise availability (because the non-upgraded daemon cannot
  participate in the new protocol).  We recommend not waiting for an
  extended period of time between ``ceph-mon`` upgrades.

* The ops log and usage log for radosgw are now off by default.  If
  you need these logs (e.g., for billing purposes), you must enable
  them explicitly.  For logging of all operations to objects in the
  ``.log`` pool (see ``radosgw-admin log ...``)::

    rgw enable ops log = true

  For usage logging of aggregated bandwidth usage (see ``radosgw-admin
  usage ...``)::

    rgw enable usage log = true

* You should not create or use "format 2" RBD images until after all
  ``ceph-osd`` daemons have been upgraded.  Note that "format 1" is
  still the default.  You can use the new ``ceph osd ls`` and
  ``ceph tell osd.N version`` commands to doublecheck your cluster.
  ``ceph osd ls`` will give a list of all OSD IDs that are part of the
  cluster, and you can use that to write a simple shell loop to display
  all the OSD version strings: ::

      for i in $(ceph osd ls); do
          ceph tell osd.${i} version
      done


Compatibility changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The 'ceph osd create [<uuid>]' command now rejects an argument that
  is not a UUID.  (Previously it would take take an optional integer
  OSD id.)  This correct syntax has been 'ceph osd create [<uuid>]'
  since v0.47, but the older calling convention was being silently
  ignored.

* The CRUSH map root nodes now have type ``root`` instead of type
  ``pool``.  This avoids confusion with RADOS pools, which are not
  directly related.  Any scripts or tools that use the ``ceph osd
  crush ...`` commands may need to be adjusted accordingly.

* The ``ceph osd pool create <poolname> <pgnum>`` command now requires
  the ``pgnum`` argument. Previously this was optional, and would
  default to 8, which was almost never a good number.

* Degraded mode (when there fewer than the desired number of replicas)
  is now more configurable on a per-pool basis, with the min_size
  parameter. By default, with min_size 0, this allows I/O to objects
  with N - floor(N/2) replicas, where N is the total number of
  expected copies. Argonaut behavior was equivalent to having min_size
  = 1, so I/O would always be possible if any completely up to date
  copy remained. min_size = 1 could result in lower overall
  availability in certain cases, such as flapping network partitions.

* The sysvinit start/stop script now defaults to adjusting the max
  open files ulimit to 16384.  On most systems the default is 1024, so
  this is an increase and won't break anything.  If some system has a
  higher initial value, however, this change will lower the limit.
  The value can be adjusted explicitly by adding an entry to the
  ``ceph.conf`` file in the appropriate section.  For example::

     [global]
             max open files = 32768

* 'rbd lock list' and 'rbd showmapped' no longer use tabs as
  separators in their output.

* There is configurable limit on the number of PGs when creating a new
  pool, to prevent a user from accidentally specifying a ridiculous
  number for pg_num.  It can be adjusted via the 'mon max pool pg num'
  option on the monitor, and defaults to 65536 (the current max
  supported by the Linux kernel client).

* The osd capabilities associated with a rados user have changed
  syntax since 0.48 argonaut. The new format is mostly backwards
  compatible, but there are two backwards-incompatible changes:

  * specifying a list of pools in one grant, i.e.
    'allow r pool=foo,bar' is now done in separate grants, i.e.
    'allow r pool=foo, allow r pool=bar'.

  * restricting pool access by pool owner ('allow r uid=foo') is
    removed. This feature was not very useful and unused in practice.

  The new format is documented in the ceph-authtool man page.

* 'rbd cp' and 'rbd rename' use rbd as the default destination pool,
  regardless of what pool the source image is in. Previously they
  would default to the same pool as the source image.

* 'rbd export' no longer prints a message for each object written. It
  just reports percent complete like other long-lasting operations.

* 'ceph osd tree' now uses 4 decimal places for weight so output is
  nicer for humans

* Several monitor operations are now idempotent:

  * ceph osd pool create
  * ceph osd pool delete
  * ceph osd pool mksnap
  * ceph osd rm
  * ceph pg <pgid> revert

v0.54
-----

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

* The osd capabilities associated with a rados user have changed
  syntax since 0.48 argonaut. The new format is mostly backwards
  compatible, but there are two backwards-incompatible changes:

  * specifying a list of pools in one grant, i.e.
    'allow r pool=foo,bar' is now done in separate grants, i.e.
    'allow r pool=foo, allow r pool=bar'.

  * restricting pool access by pool owner ('allow r uid=foo') is
    removed. This feature was not very useful and unused in practice.

  The new format is documented in the ceph-authtool man page.

* Bug fixes to the new osd capability format parsing properly validate
  the allowed operations. If an existing rados user gets permissions
  errors after upgrading, its capabilities were probably
  misconfigured. See the ceph-authtool man page for details on osd
  capabilities.

* 'rbd lock list' and 'rbd showmapped' no longer use tabs as
  separators in their output.

------------------

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

* The default search path for keyring files now includes /etc/ceph/ceph.$name.keyring.  If such files are present on your cluster, be aware that by default they may now be used.

* There are several changes to the upstart init files.  These have not been previously documented or recommended.  Any existing users should review the changes before upgrading.

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.48.2argonaut.txt>`.

v0.48.1 "argonaut"
------------------

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

* The radosgw usage trim function was effectively broken in v0.48.  Earlier it would remove more usage data than what was requested.  This is fixed in v0.48.1, but the fix is incompatible.  The v0.48 radosgw-admin tool cannot be used to initiate the trimming; please use the v0.48.1 version.

* v0.48.1 now explicitly indicates support for the CRUSH_TUNABLES feature.  No other version of Ceph requires this, yet, but future versions will when the tunables are adjusted from their historical defaults.

* There are no other compatibility changes between v0.48.1 and v0.48.

Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* mkcephfs: use default 'keyring', 'osd data', 'osd journal' paths when not specified in conf
* msgr: various fixes to socket error handling
* osd: reduce scrub overhead
* osd: misc peering fixes (past_interval sharing, pgs stuck in 'peering' states)
* osd: fail on EIO in read path (do not silently ignore read errors from failing disks)
* osd: avoid internal heartbeat errors by breaking some large transactions into pieces
* osd: fix osdmap catch-up during startup (catch up and then add daemon to osdmap)
* osd: fix spurious 'misdirected op' messages
* osd: report scrub status via 'pg ... query'
* rbd: fix race when watch registrations are resent
* rbd: fix rbd image id assignment scheme (new image data objects have slightly different names)
* rbd: fix perf stats for cache hit rate
* rbd tool: fix off-by-one in key name (crash when empty key specified)
* rbd: more robust udev rules
* rados tool: copy object, pool commands
* radosgw: fix in usage stats trimming
* radosgw: misc API compatibility fixes (date strings, ETag quoting, swift headers, etc.)
* ceph-fuse: fix locking in read/write paths
* mon: fix rare race corrupting on-disk data
* config: fix admin socket 'config set' command
* log: fix in-memory log event gathering
* debian: remove crush headers, include librados-config
* rpm: add ceph-disk-{activate, prepare}

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.48.1argonaut.txt>`.

v0.48 "argonaut"
----------------

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~

* This release includes a disk format upgrade.  Each ceph-osd daemon, upon startup, will migrate its locally stored data to the new format.  This process can take a while (for large object counts, even hours), especially on non-btrfs file systems.  

* To keep the cluster available while the upgrade is in progress, we recommend you upgrade a storage node or rack at a time, and wait for the cluster to recover each time.  To prevent the cluster from moving data around in response to the OSD daemons being down for minutes or hours, you may want to::

    ceph osd set noout

  This will prevent the cluster from marking down OSDs as "out" and re-replicating the data elsewhere. If you do this, be sure to clear the flag when the upgrade is complete::

    ceph osd unset noout

* There is a encoding format change internal to the monitor cluster. The monitor daemons are careful to switch to the new format only when all members of the quorum support it.  However, that means that a partial quorum with new code may move to the new format, and a recovering monitor running old code will be unable to join (it will crash).  If this occurs, simply upgrading the remaining monitor will resolve the problem.

* The ceph tool's -s and -w commands from previous versions are incompatible with this version. Upgrade your client tools at the same time you upgrade the monitors if you rely on those commands.

* It is not possible to downgrade from v0.48 to a previous version.

Notable changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* osd: stability improvements
* osd: capability model simplification
* osd: simpler/safer --mkfs (no longer removes all files; safe to re-run on active osd)
* osd: potentially buggy FIEMAP behavior disabled by default
* rbd: caching improvements
* rbd: improved instrumentation
* rbd: bug fixes
* radosgw: new, scalable usage logging infrastructure
* radosgw: per-user bucket limits
* mon: streamlined process for setting up authentication keys
* mon: stability improvements
* mon: log message throttling
* doc: improved documentation (ceph, rbd, radosgw, chef, etc.)
* config: new default locations for daemon keyrings
* config: arbitrary variable substitutions
* improved 'admin socket' daemon admin interface (ceph --admin-daemon ...)
* chef: support for multiple monitor clusters
* upstart: basic support for monitors, mds, radosgw; osd support still a work in progress.

The new default keyring locations mean that when enabling authentication (``auth supported = cephx``), keyring locations do not need to be specified if the keyring file is located inside the daemon's data directory (``/var/lib/ceph/$type/ceph-$id`` by default).

There is also a lot of librbd code in this release that is laying the groundwork for the upcoming layering functionality, but is not actually used. Likewise, the upstart support is still incomplete and not recommended; we will backport that functionality later if it turns out to be non-disruptive.
